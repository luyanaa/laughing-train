This is the repo to store my final project of Digital Image Processing (10061901,Tongji University). Trained on the DJI ROCO dataset (The DJI Robomaster Objects in Context), this project aims to design a system to finish object recognition of robots on the scene of DJI Robomaster competition. It should be made clear that this project is far from production level, since the dataset is acquired under ideal situation. Using this project in the production situation might cause unexpected results.
